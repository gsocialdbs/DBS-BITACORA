The previous AI engineer successfully guided the user from an initial React application with no data persistence to a fully functional, secure web application with Supabase integration and user authentication. The journey involved numerous troubleshooting steps, particularly around Supabase schema creation and persistent deployment on Netlify, eventually switching to Vercel.

Key achievements include:
- Initial codebase analysis, identifying a React app using .
- Implementing Supabase for data persistence across five distinct modules.
- Adding a robust user authentication system.
- Troubleshooting persistent deployment issues across Netlify, eventually achieving successful deployment on Vercel.
- Resolving data saving/loading issues related to Supabase schema, RLS, and application code mismatches.

The current challenge is a Vercel deployment error (

The user initially requested a database to save information for an existing Direcci칩n de Bienestar Social application. The core problem was the lack of data persistence, as the application relied solely on React's , losing all data upon page refresh.

Over the course of development, the user's requirements evolved and were met:
1.  **Data Persistence:** Implement a robust database solution (Supabase) to store patient, injured official, deceased, and indemnity information permanently.
2.  **Full CRUD Functionality:** Enable creation, reading, updating, and deletion of records across all modules.
3.  **User Authentication:** Add a login system with user and password for secure access, including persistent sessions and a logout function. This was a critical security enhancement.
4.  **Application Deployment:** Provide a publicly accessible link to the functional application, initially attempted on Netlify, then successfully achieved on Vercel.
5.  **Data Consistency:** Ensure all four main modules (Bit치cora de Pacientes, Funcionarios Lesionados, Informaci칩n de Fallecidos, Indemnizaciones) correctly save and load data without errors.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React.js:** Frontend framework for the application's UI.
- **Supabase:** Backend-as-a-Service for PostgreSQL database, authentication, and file storage.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Vercel:** Cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions, used for final successful deployment.
- **Netlify:** Cloud platform for web projects, initially used but faced persistent deployment issues.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Core web technologies used for the final single-file application.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application started as a React single-page application (SPA) but evolved into a self-contained HTML file for simplified deployment, especially to overcome issues with Netlify's build process.



**Key Files and Changes:**

-   : This file was initially created to hold Supabase API URL and anonymous key. It's crucial for configuring the Supabase client.
-   : This comprehensive SQL script defines all necessary tables (, , , , ), their columns (using UUIDs for IDs, timestamps), relationships, indices, and Row Level Security (RLS) policies. This file was repeatedly provided and corrected for the user to execute directly in the Supabase SQL editor to ensure database integrity.
-   : Initializes the Supabase client using environment variables for the URL and anon key. This file is critical for all database interactions.
-   : Contains a set of functions (, , etc.) that abstract the Supabase CRUD operations for each module. It was modified to ensure correct data formatting and error handling.
-   : The main React component. It was extensively modified to:
    -   Integrate data fetching and state management with Supabase (replacing  for persistence).
    -   Handle user authentication flow, including routing to login/dashboard based on session status.
    -   Manage active tabs for different modules.
-   : A new component created for the user authentication feature, handling username/password input and calling the  service.
-   : New file containing the  and  functions, interacting with Supabase's authentication service and managing user sessions in .
-   : A new component to wrap routes that require authentication, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.
-   : This is the most recent, fully functional single HTML file. It encapsulates all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including the Supabase integration and authentication logic, designed for easy drag-and-drop deployment on static hosting services like Vercel or Netlify. This was created to simplify deployment after repeated issues with the React build process and Netlify.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a persistent deployment issue on Vercel. The user had successfully created a new GitHub repository () and pushed the  (which is the  file renamed). However, when Vercel attempted to deploy this, it failed with the error: Error: el comando npm run build sali칩 con 1.

The problem is that Vercel, upon detecting a  in the initial project structure, automatically attempts to run

The AI engineer was providing multiple solutions to configure Vercel to treat the project as a static site and bypass this build command. This includes:
1.  Creating a  file to explicitly define static routes.
2.  Modifying the  scripts to prevent a build.
3.  Configuring Vercel project settings (Framework Preset, Build Command, Output Directory, Install Command) through the dashboard.

The conversation left off with the AI engineer detailing these solutions for the user to implement on their Vercel project settings. The underlying application code (the ) is confirmed to be fully functional, supporting all four modules with data persistence and authentication.
